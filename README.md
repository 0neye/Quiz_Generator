# A work-in-progress quiz generator using Nuxt3 and the OpenAI API

Users can create practice quizes on any topic (with varying quality)

Meant to be different to the existing quiz generator websites that make you sign up/pay to use them 
and force you to give context to generate a quiz from, which isn't always possible for students.
